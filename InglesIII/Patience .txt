Patience: 
Because when i'm teaching an activity, whether to one or more people. I can explain it several times if necessary until they understand all the content.

Communication:
because I can express my ideas clearly, I make good presentations at work and at college. I can also send different types of emails for different occasions and I can develop technical reports for projects.

Empathy:
i can understand and shelter the feelings of others. I can build strong cooperative relationships with others because i show them i care for their feelings. An example would be when I welcomed a friend who lost his job.

Organization
I can manage time, workspace and information effectively wheter at work or college. I can send ativities in advance because of my activities planning .
